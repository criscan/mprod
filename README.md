Generalized Surplus Production Model (GSPM)
(by Cristian M. Canales)

out=mprod_fits(name, graf_opt, tab_opt)

name     = "name_file.xlsx"
graf_opt = T or F (to produce model fit and population variables graphics)
tab_opt  = T or F (to produce output tables)


An Excel file is read with data separated into two spreadsheets: one with catches and CPUE by year, and the other with parameters priors. The model estimates provide different interest variables and parameters
